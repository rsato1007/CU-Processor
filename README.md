# CU-Processor
CU-Processor (name pending) is a browser-based application made for credit unions. Credit unions often rely on software that tends to lack not only intuitive UI, but also features prominent in more modern frameworks. CU-processor seeks to fix that while staying browser for easily portability.

# Technologies
This application uses the following:
-Python
-Django
-React

When choosing what tech stack I would use to build this application, I evaluated many options based on numerous factors including: scalability, learning curve, application processing speed, memory usage, and security ranking of each technology. Based on these criteria, I narrowed my choice of programming languages to: C#, Python, and Ruby. Ultimately Python was chosen for Django's scalability, and relative ease to develop. Python won since I wanted to empahsize stronger UI and Django coupled with React makes that possible.
