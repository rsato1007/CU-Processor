# CUPal
CUPal is a browser-based application made for credit unions. Credit unions often rely on software that tends to lack not only intuitive UI, but also features prominent in more modern frameworks. CUPal seeks to fix that while staying browser for easily portability.

# Technologies
This application uses the following:
- Python
- Django
- React

When choosing what tech stack I would use to build this application, I evaluated many options based on numerous factors including: scalability, learning curve, application processing speed, memory usage, and security ranking of each technology. Based on these criteria, I narrowed my choice of programming languages to: C#, Python, and Ruby. Ultimately Python was chosen for Django's scalability, and relative ease to develop. Python won since I wanted to empahsize stronger UI and Django coupled with React makes that possible.

# Current Status
This application is in early development stages. Currently, I am working on:
- ~~Application Name~~
- Implementing a bare bones ability to open a new membership (no checking, just base savings for now)
- Application Designs (Figma Link and Design Images Coming Soon)
